Welcome to my website!

I’m **Chaeyoon Kim**, an undergraduate student at **Yonsei University**, majoring in **Business Administration with a concentration in AI Business**. My academic focus lies in understanding how artificial intelligence transforms business strategies, organizational structures, and the way people work. I enjoy translating complex technological and managerial problems into clear, data-driven insights.

Through research projects, academic coursework, and internship experiences, I’ve explored topics such as AI adoption and digital platforms. My goal is to bridge the gap between technology and management—combining analytical rigor with human-centered thinking. 
I aspire to become a consultant who helps organizations leverage AI responsibly and drive meaningful innovation.
